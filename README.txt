== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which sites do you support? =
We support Skrouz.gr, Alve.com and Scrooge.co.uk.

= Where can I find the plugin's settings? =
This plugin will add the settings to the WooCommerce Integration tab. 
`WooCommerce > Settings > Integration > Skroutz Analytics`

= Where can I find the `Shop Account ID`? =
Visit skroutz for [merchants page](https://merchants.skroutz.gr/merchants/account/settings/analytics), and navigate to the Skroutz Analytics section. Otherwise you may contact your account manager.

= I don't see the code on my site. Where is it? =
Make sure you have set your Skroutz Analytics `Shop Account ID` in the plugin settings, otherwise tracking won't work.

= How can I test if Skroutz Analytics is working? =
Skroutz provides you a temporary `verification page` during the testing phase of the skroutz analytics integration. You can visit skroutz for [merchants page](https://merchants.skroutz.gr/merchants/account/settings/analytics) or contact your account manager.

= Which pages do you track? =
This plugin does not track any admin pages, only frontend pages.

= My code is there, but does not report any ecommece data. Why? =
Duplicate Skroutz Analytics code causes a conflict in tracking. Remove any other Skroutz Analytics plugins or code from your site to avoid duplication and conflicts in tracking.

= The order tax seems to be wrong. Why? =
The plugin uses the WooCommerce tax rates you have configured in the settings. If the `Enable Taxes` option is disabled, or there are no `Tax Rates` configured, a default tax rate based on the flavor/country will be used to manually the calculate the order tax from the order revenue. So to avoid that, you need to properly setup your tax rules:

* Make sure you have enabled the `Enabled Taxes` option under `WooCommerce > Settings > Tax > Tax Options`
* And you have added **at least one** `Standard Tax Rate` under `WooCommerce > Settings > Tax > Standard Rates`
* Finally the shipping tax should be included in the order tax.
    - Make sure the `Shipping checkbox` is checked in the Tax Rates table (see above)
    - Also the `Tax Status` under `WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Flat Rate` must be set to `Taxable`. Note that the `Cost` value should be set excluding tax, as the tax will be automatically applied by WooCommerce. For example if you want the shipping cost to be 5 euro, you should set the cost to 4.03, given a 24% rate tax. The same applies for all the shipping methods that are enabled for your eshop.
